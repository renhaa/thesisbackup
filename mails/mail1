Hi Sami and Stella

Here is a small update on the thesis.

#Encoding
I've changed the encoding into StyleGAN latent space (W) to use a mask
so the background is not considered when optimizing for the latent code.
This means that StyleGAN "guesses" the background when we do not constrain it to
be all black. The results are quite good for 100 iteration steps for the first two person identities
in the dataset. See the original data in figure1 and the reconstructions in figure2.

In figure 3 you see the mean face of these 2*50 data points and figure 4 the reconstruction
from the left and right perspective also.

# Decomposition
I found a way to do MLSVD/HOSVD/Tucker decomposition in Python:
I can do the decomposition with TensorFox https://github.com/felipebottega/Tensor-Fox
And doing the n-way products with https://github.com/tensorly/tensorly

So I have our data tensor T decomposed as T = S x U1 x U2 X U3.
Currently I construct T as you do in the paper as as a order 3 tensor in R^ W x P x E
where W = 18*512 latent code, P = 100 identities, E = 25 expressions

I've also implemented another way of structuring the tensor.
Here I split expression and intensity and add viewpoint since we have
3 perspectives for each data point.
This way we would have that T is of order 5 with dimensions
W (18*512) x Persons(100) x expressions(6) x intensities(4) x viewpoints (3)
But then it is not unambiguous where one would place the neutral faces.
Let me know what you think :)
In figure 6-8 i play around with the HOSVD of this tensor where
can define the mean view and mean expression and so on.
We can also do linear interpolation as in figure 5.

# Reconstruction
Now having the decomposition the next step would be to do expression
transfer to an image outside the dataset. In "Apathy" you estimate the
person and expression parameters.

To do this you construct the energy functional which for the tensor I mention in
the second case would have 4 parameters instead of two.

You use the diagonal Tikhonov regulariser and pose the problem as a
regularised least squares problem, and minimize using alternating least squares.
I don't know what the sentence above means yet and this is where I'm "stuck" at the moment :)
Do you have any good resources for solving regularised least squares problems?

If this end up working I think that would be a novel technique for semantic editing in Stylegan.
